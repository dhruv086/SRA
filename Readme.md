# SRA (Software Requirements Analyst)

**SRA** is an intelligent, AI-powered tool designed to streamline the software requirements engineering process. By leveraging Google's Gemini AI, it analyzes raw project descriptions and automatically generates comprehensive technical documentation, including functional requirements, user stories, acceptance criteria, and visual diagrams.

## 🚀 How It Works

1.  **Input**: The user provides a high-level description of their software project in the web interface.
2.  **Analysis**: The backend sends this text to the Google Gemini API with a specialized prompt to extract structured requirements.
3.  **Generation**: The AI returns a structured JSON response containing categorized requirements, entities, and Mermaid.js diagram code.
4.  **Visualization**: The frontend parses this data and renders it into interactive tabs, formatted lists, and dynamic diagrams.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Frontend
-   **Framework**: [Next.js 15](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router)
-   **Language**: TypeScript
-   **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
-   **UI Components**: [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/) (via [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/))
-   **Icons**: [Lucide React](https://lucide.dev/)
-   **Diagrams**: [Mermaid.js](https://mermaid.js.org/)

### Backend
-   **Runtime**: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
-   **Framework**: [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)
-   **AI Integration**: [Google Gemini API](https://ai.google.dev/) (`@google/generative-ai`)
-   **Utilities**: `dotenv` for configuration, `cors` for cross-origin requests.

## 🏗️ Frontend Architecture

The frontend is built with a modular component architecture focusing on user experience and data visualization.

-   **`InputSection`**: Handles user input and triggers the analysis API call.
-   **`ResultsTabs`**: The core display component that organizes the AI output into logical sections (Requirements, Stories, Diagrams, etc.).
-   **`MermaidRenderer`**: A specialized component that dynamically renders Use Case and Sequence diagrams from the Mermaid code generated by the backend.
-   **`ApiCard`**: A reusable card component for displaying API contracts and data structures.
-   **State Management**: Uses React's local state to manage the analysis lifecycle (loading, success, error) and data flow.

## ✨ Features

-   **Requirement Extraction**: Automatically identifies and categorizes Functional and Non-Functional requirements.
-   **User Story Generation**: Creates standard user stories with "As a... I want to... So that..." format.
-   **Acceptance Criteria**: Defines clear success metrics for each user story.
-   **Visual Modeling**:
    -   **Flowchart Diagrams**: Visualizes actors and their interactions with the system.
    -   **Sequence Diagrams**: Shows the flow of logic and data between system components.
-   **Entity Recognition**: Identifies key data entities and their attributes.
-   **API Contract Proposal**: Suggests potential API endpoints based on the requirements.
-   **Gap Analysis**: Highlights missing logic or potential issues in the provided description.

## 🏁 Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project locally.

### Prerequisites
-   Node.js (v18 or higher)
-   npm or yarn
-   A Google Gemini API Key

### 1. Backend Setup

Navigate to the backend directory and install dependencies:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory with your API key:

```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
PORT=3000
```

Start the backend server:

```bash
npm run dev
```
The server will start on `http://localhost:3000`.

### 2. Frontend Setup

Open a new terminal, navigate to the frontend directory, and install dependencies:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

Start the Next.js development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) (or the port shown in your terminal) to view the application.

## 📖 Usage Guide

1.  **Launch the Application**: Ensure both backend and frontend servers are running.
2.  **Enter Project Description**: In the input box, describe your software idea in plain English. Be as detailed as possible about the features, users, and goals.
    *   *Example*: "I want a task management app where users can create projects, assign tasks to team members, set due dates, and track progress with a kanban board."
3.  **Analyze**: Click the "Analyze" button (or press Enter).
4.  **Review Results**:
    *   **Requirements**: Check the Functional and Non-Functional requirements tabs.
    *   **User Stories**: Review the generated user stories and acceptance criteria.
    *   **Diagrams**: Switch to the Diagrams tab to view the Use Case and Sequence diagrams.
    *   **API**: Look at the proposed API structure.

## ⚙️ Configuration

The application is configured via environment variables.

### Backend (`backend/.env`)

| Variable | Description | Required |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Your Google Gemini API key. Get one [here](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey). | Yes |
| `PORT` | The port the backend server listens on. Default is `3000`. | No |
